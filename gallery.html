        I'm really sorry, bbcakes. I didn't think about how you'd feel earlier. I let my emotions take over, and I reacted without thinking. I know I shouldn't have let my frustration show, and I regret not communicating with you. I never meant to hurt you.
        I was just caught off guard, and that's why I reacted that way. I thought maybe you didn't love me anymore and had just given up on me, but that was my mistake. I know I surprised you even though I knew you were tired, but even in my frustration, you were on my mind—wondering if you were okay, if you made it safely, and how your day went.
        I love you so much. I may get frustrated sometimes, but my heart is always yours. Let's fix this together—I don't want a simple misunderstanding to make things worse between us. I know I'm not perfect, but I'll do everything—to rewrite our pain into joy, to make your heart safe in mine, because without you, my world has no meaning.

        I'm so proud of you bbcakes, not just for what you do, but for who you are—kind, strong, and full of heart. Watching you chase your dreams and care for others reminds me how lucky I am to have you. Keep going, bbcakes—you're capable of more than you can ever imagine, and I'll always be here, believing in you and cheering you on, mylab.
